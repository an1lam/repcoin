# Repcoin
## The ony market-based approach to reputation.

Repcoin is a platform to give credibility to the world's internet users. Search engines will bring me relevant content, but they will not bring me credible users. We need a universal system of credibility that can definitively show who knows what on the internet. Repcoin's marketplace will facilitate the creation of that data.

## Stack
- Bootstrap frontend styling
- ReactJS frontend framework
- Express middeleware
- NodeJS backend
- MongoDB database
- Npm build system (migrating away from gulp)

## Codebase
**/api**
Contains all of our models and backend route logic

**/js**
Contains all of our frontend javascript (i.e. React components and frontend routes)

**server.js**
Main application entry-point (i.e node server.js)

## Style
- Alphabetize React component imports
- Use javascript "===" instead of "=="
- Use two-space indents
- Start js files with "use strict" (allows jsxhint to work)
- Never include component lifecycle functions unless you need them
